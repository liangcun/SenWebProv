*Abstract:* This repository contains documents about a provenance model for Sensor Web. The provenance model extends the W3C PROV Data Model with Sensor Web domain vocabularies from both OGC/ISO Observations and Measurements model and Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. It is developed using Semantic Web technologies, and thus allows provenance information of sensor observations to be published as Linked Data and explored through a Web browser or a SPARQL endpoint. We develop a use case and SPARQL queries over provenance triples to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. The observation data are obtained from soil moisture/temperature monitoring network in the central Tibetan Plateau, and serialized into RDF triples using SOSA/SSA ontologies. The provenance information is recorded using the proposed provenance model for Sensor Web.
